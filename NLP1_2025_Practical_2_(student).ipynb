But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case. **Make sure you run all your code before submitting the notebook, and do not leave unnecessary print statements / cells in your notebook that are not intended for the grader.**\n",

In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

        "\n",
        "Make sure you cover at least the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
        "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
        "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
        "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring.\n",
        "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To be able to obtain a full grade (10), you should conduct further investigations.** For example, you can also investigate one the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
        "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM?\n",
        "- How do the Tai et al. Tree LSTMs compare to Le & Zuidema's formulation?\n",
        "- Or... your own research question!\n",
        "\n",
        "These examples should give you an idea of the expected scope of your further investigations. The maximum number of points awarded for these further investigations depends on the depth of your analysis, and can also be awarded for one of the further research questions already listed above.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed.\n",
        "More precisely, you should run each model with 3 different seeds, and for each of these 3 runs, evaluate the best model (according to the validation) on the test dataset. The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",

You are required to use the ACL template which you can download from or edit directly on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Make sure your names and student numbers are visible at the top. (Tip: you need to change `review` to `final` in `\\usepackage[review]{acl}`).\n",
        "You can find some general tips about writing a research paper [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/), but note that you need to make your own judgment about what is appropriate for this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "We expect you to use the following structure:\n",
        "1. Introduction (~1 page) - describe the problem, your research questions and goals, a summary of your findings and contributions. Please cite related work (models, data set) as part of your introduction here, since this is a short paper.\n",

        "    - Make clear whether the research questions are addressed or not addressed in the literature\n",
        "    - Describe the approach you use to answer the research questions\n",
        "    - Summarise your findings\n",
        "2. Background (~1/2-1 page) -\n",
        "cover the main techniques (\"building blocks\") used in your project (e.g. word embeddings, LSTM, Tree-LSTM) and intuitions behind them. Be accurate and concise.\n",
        "    - How does each technique work? (Don't just copy the formulas)\n",
        "    - What is the relation between the techniques?\n",
        "3. Models (~1/2 page) - Describe the architecture of the final models.\n",
        "    - How do you use LSTM or Tree-LSTM for the sentiment classification task?\n",
        "    - What layers do you have, how do you do classification?\n",
        "    - What is your loss function?\n",
        "    - Etc.\n",
        "4. Experiments (~1/2 page) - Describe your experimental setup. This section should allow someone else to reproduce your experiments. Describe how you evaluate the models.\n",
        "    - Task and the data\n",
        "    - Training (model, data, parameters and hyper parameters, training algorithms, supervision signals, etc.)\n",
        "    - Evaluation (e.g. metrics)\n",
        "5. Results and Analysis (~1 page). Present the results and analyse your findings.\n",
        "    - Answer each of the research questions you raised in the introduction.\n",
        "    - Use figures and tables to highlight interesting patterns\n",
        "    - What are the factors that make model A better than model B in task C? Investigate to prove their effect!\n",
        "6. Conclusion (~1/4 page). Present the conclusions that can be drawn from your experiments.\n",
        "    - What have you learned from you experiments?\n",
        "    - How do your findings relate to what is already known in the literature?\n",
        "    - Were the results as expected? Any surprising results? Why?\n",
        "    - Based on what you learned, what would you suggest doing next?\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of your report (outside of the page limit), **you are expected to include a section titled 'Use of AI tools'**. By submitting the report you and your team member(s) testify that you did not use AI (LM-based tools and assistants (e.g. ChatGPT, UvA AI Chat, Gemini, etc.)) to draft an earlier version of your work, complete your code, suggest algorithms, revise your work or make suggestions that you implemented. If you did make use of an AI tool, you should describe the uses you made of it in the 'Use of AI tools' section, or indicate that no such tool was used.\n",
        "\n",
