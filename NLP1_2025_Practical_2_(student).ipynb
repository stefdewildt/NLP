But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case. **Make sure you run all your code before submitting the notebook, and do not leave unnecessary print statements / cells in your notebook that are not intended for the grader.**\n",

In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."
