But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case. **Make sure you run all your code before submitting the notebook, and do not leave unnecessary print statements / cells in your notebook that are not intended for the grader.**\n",

        "Data sparsity and a small data set can cause *overfitting*. This is a phenomenom that is very likely to occur when training strong and expressive models, like LSTMs, on small data. In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

        "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
        "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
        "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
        "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring.\n",
        "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To be able to obtain a full grade (10), you should conduct further investigations.** For example, you can also investigate one the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
        "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM?\n",
        "- How do the Tai et al. Tree LSTMs compare to Le & Zuidema's formulation?\n",
        "- Or... your own research question!\n",
        "\n",
        "These examples should give you an idea of the expected scope of your further investigations. The maximum number of points awarded for these further investigations depends on the depth of your analysis, and can also be awarded for one of the further research questions already listed above.\n",

        "In general:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed.\n",

The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",
